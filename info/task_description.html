    If you want to play a golf on book pages, then as first you need to find holes.
    Let's do it.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a text as a sequence of strings.
    If we will place them in column in the order how they are given up to down,
    then we get an 2D array, but with various length rows.
    A hole is a single whitespace which are surrounded by letters or digits or punctuation symbols
    - up, down, left, right and both diagonals.
    Two or more spaces are not a hole.
    All "outer" characters consider as whitespaces, so a space on the can not be a hole.
    Your goal is count how many holes in the given text.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look an example:
<pre style="font-weight: bold">
How are you doing?
I'm fine. OK.
Lorem Ipsum?
Of course!!!
1234567890
0        0
1234567890
Fine! good buy!
</pre>
<br>Here we can find 3 (three) holes: before "OK"; between "Lorem" and "Ipsum"; inside "Of course!!!".
</p>


<p>
    In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible.
    The shorter your code, the more points you earn.
    Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code.
    For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used.
    350 characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 350, you earn 1 point. For example for 300 character long code earns you 50 points.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text as a list of strings (unicode for py2).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of single holes as an integer.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
golf(["How are you doing?",
      "I'm fine. OK.",
      "Lorem Ipsum?",
      "Of course!!!",
      "1234567890",
      "0        0",
      "1234567890",
      "Fine! good buy!"]) == 3
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    0 &lt; len(text) &le; 20<br>
    all(0 &lt; len(row) &le; 20 for row in text)<br>
